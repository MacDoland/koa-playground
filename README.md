## Extensions

### Docker

VSCode has some interesting ways of working with docker.

The first extension I would recommend, especially if you are not familar yet with docker commands is the Docker extension.

It will give you a visual indicator directly in the IDE on which containers are running.

## Remote - Containers

Allows you to use a Docker container as a development environment. 

Install the Remote - Containers extensions

VSCode will auto detect the devcontainer configuration file and prompt you to reload in container. Please do so. You can also trigger this from the green button on the bottom left corner of VSCode <>.
